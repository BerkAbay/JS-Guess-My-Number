# JS-Guess-My-Number
Here, I have developed an application that can Decode the numbers between 1 and 20 with JavaScript. Every time the player makes a wrong guess, his score out of 20 is deleted, and when he reaches the correct number, he receives that result as a score on the screen. Good luck :)<img width="1080" alt="Screenshot_1" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113640526/197390356-50e7535c-5d3b-4752-806d-165870b98747.png">
